## Model Deployment

The **TDX360 Travel Chatbot** is deployed using **Streamlit Community Cloud** and powered by **Groq API** for AI responses.

This project does not require hosting a separate AI model server ‚Äî it uses the **Groq API** to run powerful LLMs in the cloud.  
The chatbot is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**, which serves as both the **frontend** and the **backend**.

---

## Deployment Architecture

- **User**: Enters a travel-related query or selects a quick option.
- **Streamlit UI (Frontend + Backend)**: `app.py` manages the interface and passes messages to the backend.
- **Groq API**: Handles requests and sends them to the chosen AI model.
- **AI Model (Cloud)**: Processes the request using `llama3-8b-8192` or `mixtral-8x7b-32768`.
- **Response**: The generated answer is returned to the Streamlit app and displayed in the chat.


1. **Streamlit UI & Backend**  
   - `app.py` handles the chatbot interface, quick travel buttons, and chat history.
   - `chatbot.py` sends user messages to Groq API and retrieves AI-generated travel responses.

2. **Groq API Models**  
   - **llama3-8b-8192** ‚Üí Fast and cost-efficient, ideal for most queries.  
   - **mixtral-8x7b-32768** ‚Üí Handles larger context windows for long conversations.  

3. **Environment Variables**  
   - API key stored in `.env` file locally.
   - On Streamlit Cloud, the key is stored in **Secrets** for security.
